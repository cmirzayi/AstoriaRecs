# Astoria Recommendations

## Restaurants

### Burgers

**Petey’s** (30th Ave and 31st St)-California-style burgers. It’s supposed to mimic an Inn-N-Out burger. Delicious. Get the California fries which are covered in cheese and onions.

**Burger Club** (30th Ave and 33rd St)-These were rated like some of the best burgers in NYC at some point. They’re great. They have some sort of spicy burger with jalapenos that I like. Their fries and wings are also top notch.

**Bareburger** (31st Ave and 35th St)-“Healthy” burgers. Focused on organic and customizability. Great options for vegetarians and vegans including Impossible burgers.

### Wings

**The Huntress** (40th Ave and Crescent St)-OMG I could rave about these wings for hours. The best wings I’ve found in NYC. Also their appetizer that’s a combination of different types of fries is great too.

### Ramen

**Tamashii** (Broadway and 27th St)-I prefer this ramen shop but a lot of people like HinoMaru better. Tamashii’s veggie miso ramen though is just so good.

**HinoMaru** (Ditmars)-I’ve had their ramen and I’m a fan but I just don’t find it as memorable as Tamashii. Still a good choice if you’re in the Ditmars area.
