# Astoria Recommendations

## Restaurants

### Burgers

Petey’s (30th Ave and 31st St)-California-style burgers. It’s supposed to mimic an Inn-N-Out burger. Delicious. Get the California fries which are covered in cheese and onions.

Burger Club (30th Ave and 33rd St)-These were rated like some of the best burgers in NYC at some point. They’re great. They have some sort of spicy burger with jalapenos that I like. Their fries and wings are also top notch.

Bareburger (31st Ave and 35th St)-“Healthy” burgers. Focused on organic and customizability. Great options for vegetarians and vegans including Impossible burgers.

### Wings

The Huntress (40th Ave and Crescent St)-OMG I could rave about these wings for hours. The best wings I’ve found in NYC. Also their appetizer that’s a combination of different types of fries is great too.
